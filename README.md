This is a train Scheduling system that stores train data on a real-time firebase database.

The application demonstrates the ability to store train arrival times and to calculate the interval arrival times using a simple algorithm. The application has an administrative menu that can be used to add and remove trains. The admin interface could easily be protected with authentication. 

To Use: 
When you start the application, if any trains are stored in the firebase data store then they will be loaded automatically and all arrival times will be updated to reflect your local time. 

Administration Menu:
To add a train simply click the 'Administration' menu located on the navigation bar.
A dialog box will open giving you the ability to add new trains.
To remove a train, follow the above instructions and then click the 'remove trains' button. All trains will then show a remove icon. Select the one you want to remove and it will be removed from the data base.
